<!-- INTRO -->
{% capture intro %}
On bluesky, I recently came across Moshe Linke's ["Experimental Game Devs Who Push the Boundaries" starter pack](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/moshelinke.bsky.social/3la77saizrd25). The description for the pack is: "An attempt to bring together all artists who use game engines and real-time media to express their personal inner world. The focus here is mostly on solo developers who follow a strong personal vision." It's an admirable goal, and it's a decent list of game developers (of course, any list like this is doomed to have gaps, reveal the inclinations of its creator, and so on). Moshe left a note saying that he knew there'd be people missing, and to just ping him if anyone felt a developer should be added.

Of course, this precipitated a flurry of responses and cases for various developers, which prompted a clarification of the list's purpose and criteria: "I think there is a bit of a misunderstanding of the loose title. Pushing the boundaries in an experimental 'art-house' games way and not necessarily in a technical way. I think technical/design innovations pushing boundaries deserve a separate list, but that's not my metier. It is more about 'non-games' here. Anti games. Walking Sims. And so on." And this got me thinking about how "radical" or "boundary-pushing" I think something like a walking simulator is these days. What do we mean by "non-games," and how has that target shifted over time?

I should make a few clarifications off of the bat! I really like walking simulators. This is not an argument against their merits. I also like Moshe Linke's games (which to me have become perhaps the most "pure" example of the modern walking simulator). I'm not trying
