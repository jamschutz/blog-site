<!-- INTRO -->
{% capture intro %}
Earlier this year I replayed the _Uncharted_ games. I adored these games when I first played them as a teenager. Their extravagant Disney ride set pieces burrowed into my heart and never left. But as the years went by, and my personal aesthetics grew and altered, I began to wonder if these games -- bastions of the dreaded, on-rails AAA "cinematic" game -- would hold up at all. But something in me this summer wanted to revisit, even at the risk of muddying my love for them, and so I purchased the _Uncharted_ remaster collection and dove back into _Uncharted 2_. . . .
