- can tie it to david kanaga's music play essay
- kanaga (as i remember it) gets a lot of mileage out of essentially jazz improvisation, and the joys of that, but there are other kinds of joy from play as well!

### improvisation
very fun to just play without knowing what will come next, allow yourself to wander and stumble into surprising timbres, textures, chords, melodies

### sheet music
but also very fun to execute with craft what has been pre-ordained. also interesting to explore within a highly restrained system all the manifold methods of expression: things that are not even discernible to the untrained ear. before i studied music, i would not have been able to tell the difference between a glen gould recording of bach and a horowitz recording -- but now i can hear those nuances quite loudly. and when i approach a piece of music, i feel all the ways that executing something beautifully can be done in different ways, feel myself turning a phrase over and over in a thousand different subtleties


### collective play
also magical to play with an orchestration. even _less_ allowance for expression, but gains the beauty of collective thrill, or snapping into harmony with fifty different voices, of following the lead of someone who you trust to take you somewhere memorable
- i suppose i feel that all play, as kanaga says, is becoming "the connective tissue of things," willing links in a sprawling system. some forms of play have us stretching farther, elastic, over much more ground.

### random asides
- thinking of de koven: that games are deconstructible in service of play. but i don't think that de koven is saying _play_ is the ultimate goal -- it's joy, pleasure, interest, beauty. these are things we can find through play, but play of many forms. de koven's deconstructibility is about listening to our hearts and minds while we play and wondering if we are still interested or excited by the actions our games ask us to do. if the answer is yes, then proceed! but if the answer is no, then diverge, make fun, find the beauty. i don't think de koven is arguing for all games to be at the whims of total personal play. in fact, de koven's tennis chapter is an excellent argument against it, where interesting, fulfilling play is found as a common ground between two people. (here i am sort of on a tangent. need to focus these thoughts of course)

- i think the focus is on play and player agency -- how play's interest is not reliant on agency
- can relate to the silly discussion of "linear games" and the gradual dirty stain that entire design discipline has been tarred with. now we are stuck with a billion different horribly dull open world games that given you PURE FREEDOM to die or boredom anywhere you prefer in A HUGE OPEN WORLD.

- play being interesting comes down to: is my role here _meaningful_? (this is broadly defined)


## Music & Games as Shifting Possibility Spaces 
"the discrete concepts (music, game) themselves being 'meaningless' before they are played in this or any other construction"
- i.e. music and games must be played to be made meaningful, otherwise they're just sets of instructions without action or aesthetic
- cites Pythagorean conceptions of music, which include "COSMIC music, HUMAN music, and INSTRUMENTAL music-- only the last of which we'd still call by that name"
- and then goes on to say: "That music is the connective tissue of things, the principle of composition, assemblage considered broadly"
- "There's the _work_ and the _performance_, which are tangled but discrete, and the Work somehow manages to exist independently of sound"
- "I _do_ think there's something interesting to tunnel into here, namely the difference between _aesthetic play_ with its unspoken Many goals which may converge into an unspoken One-- and _game play_ with its explicitly spoken One goal, which may be partitioned & micromanaged in terms of a manageable Many..."
    - "But-- I don't think this is fundamental. Because I think many games are _playable_ from the aesthetic point of view as much as the _gaming pov_, and that many pieces of music are likewise playable from the _gaming_ point of view as much as from the aesthetic pov."

- says that games and music share: "PLAYSPACES" aka "SHIFTING POSSIBILITY SPACES"
    - essentially, "shifting possibility spaces" are like possibility spaces, but with a time dimension: says that normal PS is only spatial. basically, PS is the macro space of possibility from a designer's perspective: what can be done in total, etc. SPS is scoped to "the immediate sense of possibility at play in the environment," e.g.: what can be done _here and now_, which may change from moment to moment?

- cites the moment in ocarina of time where you first get access to Hyrule field, and "the dimensionality of what is possible seems to totally explode at the moment." says that "indeed these transitions end up being more of a _connective tissue_ in our lives than the supposed fixednesses themselves. That transitions, or shifts, are the _grounds_ of the life we're living.. The _flux_ idea, from Heraclitus et. al-- same thing..."

- "So, these are the two poles of the idea-- (relative) stasis and change. The first, stasis, corresponding to the "possibility space" we're all accustomed to spatializing and theorizing about. The second, _change_, corresponding to the SHIFTING, to the Time aspect of play, its music."

- "The way we each, individually, choose to engage objects in spacetime, describes the curvature of that spacetime, and it will be DIFFERENT for each player, because we are attracted to different things with differing degrees of intensity"

- "as long as the space is forever shifting, the particular instance of it that we are experiencing _right now_ cannot be counted as a mere repetition, and is _always a unique natural occurence_. We must tune into the _play_ experience, to experience even the same computational "game state" as two totally different things when we encounter it at two different times in our life... Allow our body to be the medium..."
    - i guess this dovetails with lantz's ideas of games as ever shifting / unstable systems of play; that anything can happen therein is part of their magic. true of all play! interesting to feel this on the macro level (minecraft, the world as ever-destructible, reproducible), but also the micro (playing with an orchestra)


# Miguel Sicart, Against Procedurality
- "Much like Enlightenment, then, proceduralism is a determinist, perhaps even totalitarian approach to play; an approach that defines the action prior to its existence, and denies the importance of anything that was not determined before the act of play, in the system design of the game."

- "Proceduralism, with its call for systems at the core of the essence of games and its disregard for expressive or ineffective play, turns the act of playing a game into a labor-like action, into work towards an externally decided, predetermined, and rational outcome designed by others than the players. Play becomes _external_ to the player and the play context."

- "Play is the experience of a game by a player, and play is a creative, appropriative process of understanding and engaging in a dialectic relationship with the game system and with other players (DeKoven, 2002). Play is appropriation, creation, expression, and to a certain extent submission to the rules of a game. Play is everything about a player engaged in a game, and less about the rules of such game."

- "as DeKoven puts it: "On the one hand we have the playing mind -innovative, magical, boundless. On the other is the gaming mind - concentrated, determined, intelligent. And on the hand that holds them both together we have the notion of playing well" (2002, p. 49)."

- "Games structure play, facilitate it by means of rules. This is not to say that rules determine play: they focus it, they frame it, but they are still subject to the very act of play. Play, again, is an act of appropriation of the game by players. "
    - this is _true_ but also some games simply do not work if you are not fully symbiotic with their rules! 

- "The type of conditioned play derived from strict proceduralist arguments can be defined as instrumental play, as the process of playing for other means, as play subordinated to the goals and rules and systems of the game. In this sense, play is subordinate to reason, to the logic of achievement and progression externally determined by the player."
    - _this_ is a big part of where i disagree. instrumental play can be _emotive_!

- "The player is instrumentally rational, engaging with play with the idea of, by being exposed to procedural rhetoric, become educated or persuaded. But play is not that simple, as play is not exclusively a child of reason. Play is activity between rite and reason, between rationality and emotion - and as such, it cannot, and ought not to be instrumentalized."
