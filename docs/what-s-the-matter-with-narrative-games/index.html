<p>Recently, I've been thinking a lot about narrative games. There's a few reasons for this. For one, I've recently started following <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/booked-for-the-week">&quot;What's on your bookshelf?&quot; series</a>, where they ask narrative designers what they're reading at the moment (I'll come back to this later...). But I've also been starting and stopping games a lot lately. This isn't a new development for me -- I rarely finish games, to be honest. But I've been <em>thinking</em> about this phenomen more. Games are unique in this, for me: I almost never give up early on a movie, and once I pass the 100-page mark in a book I rarely give up there, either. But for games, it's something of a marvel when I actually complete one.

<p>Most recently, I played <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, was loving it, and then I just...got tired of it, and stopped. I have some ideas for why this might be so from a gameplay / mechanics perspective, but I wanted to start by thinking about these works as <em>narratives</em>. Why isn't the desire to find out how a story concludes strong enough to keep me going, as it is in other media? The other day I saw <em>Conclave</em>, which is fine -- fun and juicy, and not too much more -- and I never once even thought about leaving mid-film. I think <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is a far more interesting, accomplished, nuanced work, and one I'll continue to think about, while <em>Conclave</em> I'll probably forget I saw in a year's time. So what's going on here, anyways?

<p>The first place I want to start is genre. As I said, I've been reading through <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/booked-for-the-week">&quot;What's on your bookshelf?&quot; series</a>, and as I clicked through the dozens of entries found myself growing increasingly, frantically distraught: you can count on a single hand the number of times a non-fantasy or sci-fi book has been mentioned. One hand!! It turns out the only thing narrative designers are reading is sci-fi / fantasy. I'll give the requisite disclaimers here that of course genre fiction is fine, good even. I like sci-fi! I like fantasy! This year I've read 14 sci-fi / fantasy books; it's a regular part of my diet. But it is not the <em>only</em> part of my diet. Like any genre (including literary fiction, of course), it has strengths and weaknesses, things it tends to do and things it tends to lean away from. Namely, sci-fi / fantasy has a strong emphasis on place and worlds, on character archetypes, and it tends to gravitate towards &quot;save the world&quot; plots. Again, these are fun! But they are a narrow slice of the storytelling universe.
