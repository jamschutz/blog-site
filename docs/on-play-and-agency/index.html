<p>Earlier this year I replayed the <em>Uncharted</em> games. When I first played them as a teenager, their extravagant Disney ride set pieces left a deep and loving impression on me. But as the years went by, and my personal aesthetics grew and altered, I began to wonder if these games —— bastions of the dreaded on-rails AAA &quot;cinematic&quot; game —— would hold up at all. Would they be too stiff in their play? Would I be rendered a mindless zombie in their world, divorced from play, going through the motions without thought or energy? But something in me this summer wanted to revisit, even at the risk of muddying my penchant for them, and so I purchased the <em>Uncharted</em> remaster collection and dove back in. . . .

<p>And I loved it. Since then I've been thinking about the nature of play, and more specifically <em>instrumental</em> play. What is it that makes these <em>Uncharted</em> games tick for me? Certainly it's not &quot;player expression&quot; or creativity or my agency in the world. The best parts of the game are where you're more or less on rails. Maybe I'm just a boring player . . . (quite possible) but I wanted to think through some possibilities here. First, I guess I should start with why it's <em>surprising</em> these games work for me at all.

    Part 1: Instrumental Play
</div>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph" style=""></p>
<p></div></p>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph" style=""></p>
<p>To begin with, I should define <em>instrumental play</em>. Instrumental play is a form of play borne out of the <em>proceduralist</em> school of ludological thought. Proceduralism is, in essence, the claim that the rules of a game have themes, feelings, thoughts, etc embedded in their formal properties. It's the claim that a mechanic can make a player <em>feel</em> a certain way, think a certain thought. We feel vulnerable or heroic in <em>Dark Souls</em> because the <em>mechanics themselves</em> make us feel this way.
</div></p>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph" style=""></p>
<p></div></p>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph" style=""></p>
<p>The basic argument against proceduralism is that it denies the player's involvement in the meaning-making of a game. Games are systems, true, but they are systems made active <em>only</em> by the player's involvement. As David Kanaga says in his essay <a href="http://wombflashforest.blogspot.com/2013/11/music-games-as-shifting-possibility.html">&quot;Music &amp; Games as Shifting Possibility Spaces&quot;</a>, if we take the idea that games are the rules they are made of, they are still &quot;'meaningless' before they are played.&quot; Games need players —— more than that, players are actively involved in the course a game takes.

<p>In his essay <a href="https://gamestudies.org/1103/articles/sicart_ap">&quot;Against Procedurality&quot;</a> (which this essay is somewhat in response to) Miguel Sicart says this:
</div></p>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph" style=""></p>
<p></div></p>
<div class="Blog-quote">
    Much like Enlightenment, then, proceduralism is a determinist, perhaps even totalitarian approach to play; an approach that defines the action prior to its existence, and denies the importance of anything that was not determined before the act of play, in the system design of the game. [...] The type of conditioned play derived from strict proceduralist arguments can be defined as instrumental play, as the process of playing for other means, as play subordinated to the goals and rules and systems of the game. In this sense, play is subordinate to reason, to the logic of achievement and progression externally determined by the player.

<p><div class="Blog-paragraph" style="margin-top: 60px;"></p>
<p>For Sicart, play is about the <em>player</em>. And it's a reasonable stance! Why would we play at all if we are at the whims of someone else's desires? Play is, as he says, the <em>appropriation</em> of a game by a player. It's making something our own, having our involvement mean something, expressing ourselves. Certainly I have been the victim of instrumental play in the past, forced to play a part I didn't believe or have interest in.

When I think of play, I often think of games of _expression_ and _creativity_. In Miguel Sicart's <a href="https://gamestudies.org/1103/articles/sicart_ap">"Against Procedurality"</a> (which this essay is somewhat in response to) he says this of play:

<div class="Blog-quote">
    Play is the experience of a game by a player, and play is a creative, appropriative process of understanding and engaging in a dialectic relationship with the game system and with other players (DeKoven, 2002). Play is appropriation, creation, expression, and to a certain extent submission to the rules of a game. Play is everything about a player engaged in a game, and less about the rules of such game.
