<p>Lately, I've found myself playing a lot of cinematic games. It's a genre of games that I think has become somewhat maligned in the years between now and 2007 or so. And a lot of this is fair! Who among us has not weathered the inanity of a thousandth vapid cutscene, or felt our hearts dropping to the encroachment of pillarbox bars — certainly, many a media crime has been committed in the name of the &quot;cinematic.&quot; But I've found myself something of a meek defender of the namesake (&quot;it's not all bad!&quot; I say to an empty theater). In any case, I feel the term is not totally understood. We feel when a game lapses into the cinematic, but I haven't found anything that fully articulates what exactly is <em>happening</em>, what makes for a &quot;cinematic game?&quot; So I wanted to attempt to pin it down! This will be the first part of a two-part series — here I want to try and explore what exactly is a cinematic game, and in part 2 I want to try and articulate where, how, and why I think these techniques can work (and not work). Something like theory (pt. 1) and practice (pt. 2), but not exactly. Okay here goes...

<p>The obvious first stop for defining a cinematic game is one that's trying to emulate cinema in some way. In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-naughty-dog-on-uncharted/1100-6181783/">2007 interview with GameSpot</a>, Naughty Dog's copresident Evan Wells said the goal was to &quot;make you feel like you're starring in a big-budget summer blockbuster...you can feel like you're blurring that line and feel like you're in a movie.&quot; The goal, at least for Naughty Dog, is to make something like a playable movie. Remember those <em>Indiana Jones</em> films you loved — what if you could be in them? I think this is a pretty good starting point. The goal is to be <em>immersed</em> in something, to be pulled into the cinematic worlds we've been watching in theaters, living rooms, smart phones and concert halls, and inhabit it with videogame goggles. But more than that — more than just existing in these worlds — the goal is to be the &quot;star,&quot; to take charge and fortune, to be the central cog of an explosive machine.
</div></p>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph"></p>
<p></div></p>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph"></p>
<p>It should be noted that cinematic immersion is different from the typical videogame immersion. Usually, the goal is to be immersed in a world. When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-qanda-overview-character-development-fallout/1100-6111720/">pitching <em>Oblivion</em></a>, Todd Howard said the philosophy for the game was: &quot;Live another life, in another world,&quot; or put another way, &quot;'big-world, do-anything'...the player needs a certain size and a large number of choices to really make role-playing feel meaningful.&quot; During development of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-next-gen-dragon-age-inquisition-will-have-more-immersive-world">producer Cameron Lee talked excitedly</a> of a similar goal: &quot;On gen four you'll see far better graphics and, more importantly, a much more immersive world...We've got these big open worlds. How much content we can put in there and how big that can be and how complex that environment can be can be pushed farther on gen four.&quot; The AAA ideal is an endless world that's &quot;lifelike.&quot; This means graphical realism, human-like NPCs, never-ending content, and a pantheon of decisions to make role-playing in the world provide no friction against the player's imagination. You can be anything in these worlds, go anywhere, do anything — it's like real life, but in a videogame. Compare this to Naughty Dog's desire to &quot;make you feel like you're starring in a big-budget summer blockbuster.&quot; For Naughty Dog, the goal is character over world, narrowed feeling over a blank canvas. But even more than this, their cinematic immersion maintains the awareness of falsity: to play <em>Uncharted</em> is to play as both Nathan Drake — affable, down-on-his-luck treasure hunter — and his Hollywood actor (the goal is not to <em>be</em> in a blockbuster, but to &quot;star&quot; in it). We are not to believe that we are in a real world, but a <em>cinematic</em> world. We feel the impossibility in these scenarios, the dramatically-dire heroics, the conveniently-tipped scales, and we feel these impossibilities as part of the game's thrill. We don't balk at a tank running out of energy just before Nathan Drake does. We are aware of the designer's hand in making these things snap into place, aware of the carefully drawn arcs of the narrative, but rather than feel the experience cheapened, we are thrilled by it. Indeed, the game is all the more thrilling for these finely-tuned dramatics, for that, after all, is good storytelling.

<p><div class="Blog-paragraph"></p>
<p>This, then, is the cinematic. To put it plainly, the cinematic is about the immersion of a pre-defined <em>character</em>. Play <em>Uncharted</em> and you'll feel like Indiana Jones! This is not something inherently unique to cinematic games (see the dozens of articles proclaiming how X superhero game makes you &quot;feel like [superhero]&quot;), but it is something I believe, in almost all cases, to be their goal. The cinematic game is character-forward. And this means, of course, that it's a narrative game.
</div></p>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph"></p>
<p></div></p>
<p><div class="Blog-paragraph"></p>
<p>So is that all it takes, then? To be a narrative game with filmic allusions? It's not enough. If a narrative game citing film is enough to qualify, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcYcX0wfJ_0"><em>E.T.</em> for the Atari 2600</a> is cinematic. There's more, but we have a start! And to dig deeper I want to rewind a bit...

<!-- This is all well and good, but it doesn't give us a lot to go on. _How_ is that achieved? If simple allusion to a film is enough to make something "cinematic" then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcYcX0wfJ_0">_E.T._ for the Atari 2600</a> is cinematic...In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-drakes-fortune-first-impressions">a Eurogamer interviewer</a> leading up to its release, director Amy Hennig said that _Uncharted_ was going for "emotional realism." "Emotional realism," she says, "is about creating characters you can buy into as real, down-to-earth, authentic people. They're not over-drawn, over-the-top cartoon characters."

To begin, it seems to me that the "cinematic" is about immersion of _character_. This stands in constrast to the traditional videogame fantasy of immersion in a world. When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-qanda-overview-character-development-fallout/1100-6111720/">pitching _Oblivion_</a>, Todd Howard said the philosophy for the game was: "Live another life, in another world," or put another way, "'big-world, do-anything'...the player needs a certain size and a large number of choices to really make role-playing feel meaningful." 

Hennig says _Uncharted_ is going for "emotional realism": "'Emotional realism is about creating characters you can buy into as real, down-to-earth, authentic people. They're not over-drawn, over-the-top cartoon characters,' says Hennig.

Eurogamer review: "Uncharted seems to actively want to keep you immersed and entertained instead of wandering around cluelessly clicking or jumping on everything in the vain hope of it being the right path" "the game's ongoing narrative and action feeling like a sequence of vaguely connected set-pieces, most of the chapters in the game flow expertly into one another. At times, this carefully 'directed', orchestrated approach lets the action and adventure ebb and flow in pace, drama and atmosphere."

outline: 

cinematic not clearly understood: what is it?

- in some ways i wonder if it's something of a misnomer. something is "cinematic" in the sense that tarvkosky is painterly, or nuri bilge ceylan is photographic (or ozu) -- perhaps Anthony Mann could be said to be like a draughtsman, with the focus on light and form, and so on and so forth

- about immersion of *character* rather than immersion of *place*

- prestige, spectacle

- plot (story games)

- control taken away
    - metagaming, to play the cinematic is to cede those possibilities and relinquish control, consent to it, etc
    - well played game, to play well is to do this (maybe mention in metal gear / 30 flights further down)

- cinematic as externalization of a character's internality, their psychology
    - linda hutcheon's tell, show, interact
    - showing feelings through lighting, or camera
    - closeness to the psychology of the character, which of course risks tension in how we view ourselves in our own play as the character

- uses camera, lighting, blocking, edits to convey the psychology of the character
    - Cyberpunk 2077 (blocking feels coreographed! even if it's not, blocking is deliberate to make for good composition; camera is restricted; movement is disabled; etc)

    - Beginner's Guide walking backwards: not cinematic because it doesn't give you anything about the character
    - other examples outside cinematic: architectural games (Hitman, Control)

    - interesting to note here that other media do this! even things like JJ Abrams lens flares are pointing explicitly at technical limitations of other media, Brian Eno essay on attachment to this, etc etc

    - also can note the corruption of form that happens here (close up, one take, these things lose their "meaning" when adapted)

- why make these games then?
    - the fact that they only begin to appear in the 90s tells us something about the reasons. for one visual fidelity of cinema can be recreated. for another a generation of creators self consciously making something as a "true work of art," borrowing cultural capital of film and trying to rub it off on something as culturally low and pitiable as a videogame.

    - take half life 2. in these scenes characters are going through things and feelings; games hesitant to externalize of declare what a character is feeling: supposed to be derived through play not story. but when making storytelling games this is difficult! unproductive tension between story and play in half life 2, imo. versus metal gear 5 where important story beats that inform everything surrounding it take control away from player.
        - also want to bring up arkham asylum -- standing and listening is boring! later, in arkham knight, when you turn and the scene changes, much better storytelling. here the drama is through play and interaction, which "justifies" keeping the player in control (there is something to do, to be gained, to play a part in!)
        - versus in half life 2 where you are "out of the scene" but are mysteriously left in control of your character. could of course argue that it's fun to stomp on their faces and run streaking in circles flailing wildly at wooden boxes while they're having a serious conversation! but i feel the game either needs to lean into that and emphasize the goofiness of the scenario, or else find a way to make play integral to the storytelling there, or else just use a cutscene! people use them for a reason, after all

- examples of cinematic games
    - Metal Gear 5. playing through cinematic could be called "theatrical" in the sense that its participatory, told through being a part of the play. But actually it's on rails. More like an interactive pre authored cinema scene. Here, the tension is not "can I perform this?" but rather "what will happen next?" By placing you the player as the central actor the screen's unraveling takes on new meaning: it's never clear when the game's control will give way to the player's and in this way a sense of play, ownership, and tension is created. Also well-played game idea here: playing this well is being in tune with what the game wants and consenting to play along. interesting to note that as the intro goes along the cinematic gives way to "gaminess." as you get more and more control of the character you feel less and less of the "cinematic" -- yet this is not to say the cinematic goes away

    - 30 flights line is more blurred: "what will happen next" is partnered with "can I perform this," but also the urgency of the scene, the drama will not work if you don't play your part well, and in this way performing well and "correctly" becomees part of the thrill, being a good actor and player within a play space whose success is reliant on something more than ourselves alone.

    - uncharted. "can i perform this" is much bigger question. all of these have their own qualities.

    - Cyberpunk 2077 scene

    - assassin's creed 2 opening.



when does the cinematic work / not work?

- when disruption is predictable, and serves a clear purpose, it's okay (Dark Souls: amps you up for a big fight, serves the drama!; versus Dragon's Dogma, which takes the life out of the scene, makes for awkward pacing, for me doesn't serve drama, or perhaps it's that the fight doesn't live up to the expectation which makes the whole thing feel a little limp and silly)

- when it's clear that what's being cinemafied is *better* cinemafied (Uncharted cutscenes, Assassin's Creed 2 intro, even Metal Gear 5 helicopter cutscene with Quiet taking control -- you don't ever have control of the scene and so it makes sense (though imo a little too long...))

- can bring up well played game again that the game should respect the player here as an autonomous agent! curious how to define when this works...

- you need to decide if your game is a story game or not a story game..........don't waste my time!! cutscenes better move the drama forward in some way! (Assinassin's Creed Odyssey)

- should still always serve the play. assassin's creed adapting filmic dialog to action, talking with Da Vinci in Venice and walking in a cirlce. West Wing




for something like Star Wars or Dragon's Dogma, these cut scenes eat up the scene's drama, AND the action in the cutscene is the action you'd do with gameplay -- in short, when i watch these cutscenes, i think, "i'd rather be playing this than watching this." compare to e.g. the snake scene in sekiro
