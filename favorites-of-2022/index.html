                    I guess the last time I did one of these was four years ago…wow! This year I played a lot of wonderful games, though the vast majority of them were made by friends and peers (journalistic integrity be damned). I suppose these sorts of lists are somewhat self-indulgent, but I enjoy making them, so here it is! This year I decided to include my favorite movies and books I enjoyed over the year as well. The list isn't ranked at all — everything is listed in the order in which I came to it — and I didn't bother to trim it to only “the top ten” or anything. Different things resonated with me for different reasons, and why shouldn't we praise and celebrate generously, after all? If something stuck with me, however large or small, I've included it below.

                    I am working on a game about goodbyes right now, and it has made me realize how complicatedly beautiful these “goodbyes” to the new year are — celebrations for some of the most difficult aspects of our lives: change, age, and the loss of time. But, of course, these are not empty losses. They are bounties, harvests of wisdom and friendship and, yes, the odd videogame. Here are some things I was grateful for this year.

                        I go through regular spirals with AAA games where I wonder if I even like videogames — long stretches of time where I pick something up, then put it down feeling cold. It's sort of disheartening. I'm not sure how much of it is due to the sheer amount of time I spend with videogames numbing me to their effects, versus what feels like an increasingly commodified field that churns out more “content” than art.

                        Regardless, Elden Ring came through for me. It's a world with real mystery to it, predictably-satisfying combat, and an open world design that — well, it doesn't exactly get rid of the oft-derided Ubisoft model — but nonetheless it sands it down to be less gaudy and irksome. I enjoyed flying through fields and forests, and dying spectacular, humiliating deaths.

                        I did find it to be a bit bloated…what's the deal with these hundred hour games, anyways. I didn't finish it, and I probably won't, but that's a small price to pay to be enamored with AAA games again. Thanks, Elden Ring :)

                        This one is sort of cheating because the game is still being worked on and isn't publicly available anywhere, but I got a chance to play it hot and fresh earlier in the year and haven't stopped thinking about it since. There is such a dense air of alienation and longing in this game, while you poke and prod at a mezze plate of serenely beautiful, muted dioramas. If anything else like it exists, I've not played it. Whenever it does come it out — it's essential playing. In the meantime, you can play through <a href="https://gurnburial.itch.io/">GURN GROUP's other games</a>, which are short, strange, and fascinating.
